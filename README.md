# 🚗 Smart Parking Management System

## 📌 Introduction
The Smart Parking Management System is a console-based application developed using C++. It helps in managing parking slots efficiently by allowing users to park vehicles, remove vehicles, and monitor parking availability.

This project demonstrates the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and data structures in real-world problem solving.

## ⚙️ How The System Works
1. User selects parking option
2. System assigns parking slot automatically
3. Vehicle details are stored in file
4. When vehicle exits, system calculates parking duration
5. Records are updated automatically
